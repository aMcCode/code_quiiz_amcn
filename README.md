# code_quiz_amcn

AS A coding boot camp student<br />
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores<br />
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

* GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
* WHEN I click the start button<br />
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
* WHEN I answer a question<br />
THEN I am presented with another question
* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly<br />
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0<br />
THEN the game is over
* WHEN the game is over<br />
THEN I can save my initials and score
